#510 Lab 2

## Goal of this lab:
- Scrape events holds in Seattle from https://visitseattle.org
- Scrape detail information from the events and store the data as CSV
- Get latitude and longitude of each events' location
- Rely on the lat and lon to get grid point and get the short weather summary for each event and store the data as CSV

## What's Included

- Jupyter notebook `visitseattle.ipynb`
- A CSV that store events detials `events.csv`
- A CSV that store events details and short weather summaries `extended_events_with_weather.csv`

## What I have Learned From This Lab

- Finding and copying the detail information's selector
- Using Beautifulsoup to scrape the website url and some detail information
- Knowing how to store the data as CSV

## Questions / Uncertainties

- Can we get the weather summary without grid point? (only using latitude and longitude)
